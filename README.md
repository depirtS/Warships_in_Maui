# Warships in .NET MAUI

> 
> #### What is this?
>
> - This is my first project in .NET MAUI. I have created a warship game application that runs on Windows and Android. The application is written using object-oriented programming, NavigationPage and supports several languages. It supports playing with a bot or player on two boards (5x5 and 7x7).

> #### What is the .NET MAUI?
>
> - .NET MAUI is an evolution of Xamarin.Forms and is a new framework for creating modern, cross-platform native applications for iOS, Android, macOS and Windows using C# and XAML in a single code repository.

> 
> #### What does NavigationPage provide?
>
> - NavigationPage provides hierarchical navigation, where you can navigate through pages, forwards and backwards, as required. NavigationPage is typically used to navigate through a stack of ContentPage objects. When one page navigates to another, a new page is added to the stack and becomes the active page.

> - In order to install the applications, the .NET MAUI framework must be downloaded in Visual Studio and the application must be downloaded to the mobile device or run in windows.
> - The .NET MAUI framework must be downloaded in Visual Studio.
> - The repository must be cloned and opened in Visual Studio.
> - To download the applications to the mobile device, you need to connect the device with a cable to your computer and run the applications on it, selecting it as the location to run the application in Visual Studio.
> - To make the app work on windows, you need to run it from the project using Visual Studio.
> - In the future, I plan to add the installation of the game directly from the repository without installing the entire framework along with opening the code.
